Problem Statement

Many small educational institutes need a lightweight system to manage students, teachers, courses, enrollments, grades, and simple analytics (reporting). Existing enterprise solutions are heavy, expensive, or require significant setup. A console-based Java system provides a minimal, extendable way to demonstrate core concepts learned in class: data modelling, object-oriented design, persistence, modular design, and reporting.

Scope
- Implement core CRUD for students, teachers, and courses
- Support student enrollment and grade assignment
- Provide reporting: student transcript and course analytics
- Persist data to local storage using file-based serialization

Target Users
- Small educational instructors, course assistants, or students demonstrating project work

High-level Features
- Create and manage students and teachers
- Create courses and enroll students
- Assign grades and compute averages/GPA
- Generate printable reports via console
