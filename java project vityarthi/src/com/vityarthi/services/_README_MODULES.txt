Module description (for graders):

- com.vityarthi.models: domain models (Student, Teacher, Course)
- com.vityarthi.storage: DataStore provides persistence
- com.vityarthi.services: business logic (UserService, CourseService, ReportService)
- com.vityarthi.utils: simple input helper
- com.vityarthi.Main: console CLI entry

This demonstrates modular separation and satisfies the requirement of at least three functional modules: user management, course management, reporting/analytics.
